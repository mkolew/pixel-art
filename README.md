Canvas API support required.

## Deploy

Cloudflare, from GitHub Actions — `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` runs `npm ci && npm run build`
on every push to `main` and publishes `out/` with `wrangler`. Two repository secrets are
required: `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` and `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`.

`next.config.ts` sets `output: 'export'`, so the build is a static one — `out/` is plain files,
served with no server runtime and no Worker invocation. Cloudflare serves static assets free and
unlimited, so traffic cannot exhaust a quota or produce a bill. The app has no API routes, no
middleware and no server actions, so nothing is lost by exporting.

If a future change needs server-side rendering, `output: 'export'` has to go and the app needs an
adapter — at which point every request becomes a metered Worker call. Worth knowing before adding
one.
